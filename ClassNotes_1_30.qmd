## DataFrame versus Tibble

There are certain functions that will only work with tibbles and certain functions that only work with dataframes. So you need to be aware of which one you are using

### Data Frame

```{r}
f <- "/Users/yesenialanda/Repos/data-analysis-replication/CPDS-1960-2014-reduced.csv"
```

```{r}
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE)
```

``` r
d
```

###Tibble

```{r}
f <- "/Users/yesenialanda/Repos/data-analysis-replication/CPDS-1960-2014-reduced.csv"
```

``` r
d <- read_csv(f, col_names = TRUE)
```

``` r
d
```

You can convert from dataframe to tibble or tibble to dataframe

``` r
d <- as_tibble(d)
d <- as.data.frame(d)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
f <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-datasets/refs/heads/main/KamilarAndCooperData.csv"
```

```{r}
d <- read_csv(f, col_names = TRUE)
```

``` r
d
```

##Accessing Variables using attach(), detach(), and with()

attach() lets us use variable names directly

```{r}
mean(d$Brain_Size_Species_Mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Attach data frame to working directory in R, now you wont. have to do d\$ each time

```{r}
attach(d)
```

```{r}
mean(Brain_Size_Species_Mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

You can also detach using, this will detach and then you can attach another data frame or just specify what data fram you are reffering too.

``` r
detach()
```

The with version is sort of a local version of attaching

```{r}
with(
  d,
  mean(Body_mass_female_mean, na.rm = TRUE)) #have not attached or detached
```

## Tidy Data
![](images/tidydata.png)

``` R
install.packages("skimr")
```

```{r}
library(skimr)
```
```{r}
boxplot(log(d$Body_mass_female_mean))
stripchart(log(d$Body_mass_female_mean),
           method = "jitter",
           col = "blue",
           vertical = TRUE,
           add = TRUE)
```

```{r}
boxplot(data = d, log(Body_mass_female_mean) ~ Family)
stripchart(data = d, log(Body_mass_female_mean) ~ Family,
            method = "jitter", #moves points from side to side so they are not stacked right above eachother and now you can visualize where the points are
            col = "blue", #color of points
            vertical = TRUE,
            add = TRUE)
```


```{r} 
p <- ggplot(
          data = d,
          aes(x = Family, y = log(Body_mass_female_mean))
        )+
  geom_boxplot(na.rm = TRUE) +
  geom_jitter(color = "blue", width = 0.1)
p
```

```{r}
p <- p + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle =90))
p <- p + ylab("log(Female Body Mass)")
p
```
